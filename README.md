# William Lotho Chavez - AI-Native Full-Stack Engineer

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm William, a solo developer and founder with 5+ years equivalent experience building production-ready SaaS platforms. I specialize in AI-driven solutions using React/TypeScript, Node.js/Express equivalents, Postgres/SQL, and tools like Cursor, Copilot, and OpenAI APIs.

I build human-centered AI systems that turn data and automation into useful, accessible tools for everyday life.

## Key Skills
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript 5.6, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
- **Backend/Database**: Node.js/Express (via Edge Functions), Postgres/SQL (Schemas, RLS, Optimizations)
- **AI & Tools**: Prompt Engineering, OpenAI Integrations, Intelligent Caching, Recommendation Engines
- **Other**: Real-Time Systems, Performance Optimization, Multi-Tenant Architectures

## Featured Projects
- **[KitchAI](https://github.com/KitchAIv1/version1)**: AI-powered food social app with GPT-4o pantry scanning, recipe generation, and TikTok-style feeds. Built solo with React Native and Supabase.
- **[MAXPULSE](https://github.com/KitchAIv1/maxpulse-complete)**: AI-driven wellness SaaS with real-time tracking, health metrics forecasting, and recommendation engines. Features 31-table Postgres schema and 73% cache hit rates.

## Now
Building **MaxPulse App** (AI wellness platform for lifestyle analytics) and **EMSIS** (AI-powered school management system with real-time attendance and analytics).

## About My Work
As a solo dev, I handle end-to-end developmentâ€”from architecture to deployment. My projects emphasize rapid iteration, AI-assisted velocity (10x gains), and enterprise-grade quality (95+ Lighthouse scores, WCAG 2.1 AA).
